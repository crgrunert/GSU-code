This repository contains code from coursework during my PhD program at GSU. Below, you'll find a brief description of each file.

[Logit and Probit Regression](/Logit%20and%20Probit%20Regression.pdf)

   ## This code was created while I was learning about the importance of logit and probit regression. In the PDF file, you will see the commands within R Commander and how certain parameters were set for a specific *particularly* binary outcome of the data of interest. Furthermore, this file is briefly touches on probit regression in relation to how it differs from logit regression.


[Week 2_Linear Regression](/Week%202_Linear%20Regression.R)

   ## This code depicts variables of interest to determine if there is any correlation or relationship between them using linear regression. 

[final data analysis](/final%20data%20analysis.R)

   ## This code is summarizing all of the types of analyses we discussed in my Advanced Quantitative Methods course at Georgia State University. Furthermore, it depicts following clear and concise directions presented by the instructor for grading purposes. This Rfile displays which tests were required by the instructor in addition to including analyses that will require proper interpretation. 


[final exam q2](/final%20exam%20q2.R)

   ## This code is summarizing all of the types of analyses we discussed in my Advanced Quantitative Methods course at Georgia State University. Furthermore, it depicts following clear and concise directions presented by the instructor for grading purposes. This Rfile displays which tests were required by the instructor in addition to including analyses that will require proper interpretation. 

[research project analysis](/research%20project%20analysis.R)

   ## This R code includes variables of interest for analyses for my final project for class. The included code was up to my sole discretion and ultimatley responsible for choosing and defending why I chose specific analyses and correctly interpretting such resuls.
